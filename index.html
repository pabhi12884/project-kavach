      <h1>Project Kavach – Secure Email Agent</h1>

      <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Email is the most common entry point for cyberattacks. Phishing, spoofing, and malware-laced attachments are often missed by traditional filters. With the rise of targeted social engineering attacks, it's no longer enough to rely on rule-based spam filters. We need a smarter, adaptive solution.</p>

      <p><strong>What Project Kavach Does:</strong> It’s an open-source email agent designed to provide intelligent, explainable security for Gmail. The agent deeply inspects every email using trusted techniques — no shortcuts or unverifiable decisions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Scans headers and body for phishing, spoofing, and impersonation attempts</li>
        <li>Validates all domains and URLs against real-time threat intelligence databases</li>
        <li>Analyzes attachments in isolated sandboxes (e.g., Any.Run) for malicious behavior</li>
        <li>Explains why emails are marked as spam or sent to trash — no black-box behavior</li>
        <li>Allows users to correct the agent's actions, and it adapts to improve over time</li>
        <li>Designed with security-first principles — no persistent email storage, no remote control risks</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How It Evolves:</strong> Every user correction helps the agent learn and become more accurate. Over time, it builds a contextual understanding of what is and isn't a threat, tailored to your usage — without compromising on transparency or safety.</p>

      <p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> Project Kavach is fully open-source. Our goal is to create a trustworthy, verifiable system that anyone can audit, contribute to, and use. This is a real solution to a real problem — built by and for the security community.</p>

      <p>We're starting with Gmail integration to test and refine the model, then expanding further. Join us in building a smarter, safer inbox.</p>
