    <h1>Project Kavach – Email Security AI-Agent </h1>

    <section>
      <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Email remains the most common entry point for cyberattacks. Phishing, spoofing, and malware attachments often bypass basic filters. Evolving social engineering tactics require smarter, adaptive security solutions.</p>

      <p><strong>What Project Kavach Does:</strong> An open-source AI agent that deeply analyzes every Gmail email with trusted methods — no black-box decisions.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Inspects headers and content for phishing, spoofing, and impersonation</li>
        <li>Validates domains and URLs using real-time threat intelligence</li>
        <li>Analyzes attachments securely via sandboxing (e.g., Any.Run)</li>
        <li>Explains why emails are marked spam or moved to trash</li>
        <li>Allows user corrections to help the agent learn and improve</li>
        <li>Designed with security-first principles — no persistent storage risks</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How It Evolves:</strong> User feedback enables contextual adaptation and transparency.</p>

      <p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> Project Kavach is fully open-source, delivering real solutions for real problems through community collaboration.</p>

      <p>Currently focusing on Gmail integration to test and improve, aiming for a smarter, safer inbox.</p>
