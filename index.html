    <h1>Project Kavach – Email Security AI-Agent</h1>

    <section>
      <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Email is the most common entry point for cyberattacks. Phishing, spoofing, and malware-laced attachments often bypass traditional filters. With the rise of targeted social engineering, basic spam filters aren’t enough. We need a smarter, adaptive solution.</p>

      <p><strong>What Project Kavach Does:</strong> An open-source email agent designed to provide intelligent, explainable security for Gmail. The agent deeply inspects every email using trusted techniques.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Scans headers and body for phishing, spoofing, and impersonation attempts</li>
        <li>Validates domains and URLs with real-time threat intelligence</li>
        <li>Analyzes attachments using isolated sandboxes (e.g., Any.Run)</li>
        <li>Explains why emails are marked spam or sent to trash — no guesswork</li>
        <li>Lets users correct decisions, learning and adapting over time</li>
        <li>Built with security-first principles — no persistent storage or remote risks</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>How It Evolves:</strong> User feedback helps the agent improve, building contextual understanding tailored to your inbox  with transparency and safety.</p>

      <p><strong>Our Vision:</strong> Project Kavach is fully open-source. It’s a real solution to a real problem</p>

      <p>We’re starting with Gmail integration to test and improve the model, then expanding. Join us to build a smarter, safer inbox.</p>
